If you know how to run jupyter notebooks locally, just download 
[MPCP.ipynb](https://github.com/mgrigni/cs424s19/raw/master/MPCP.ipynb).

Otherwise, to launch a "live" instance of the MPCP notebook, click here: 
[![Binder](https://mybinder.org/badge_logo.svg)](https://mybinder.org/v2/gh/mgrigni/cs424s19/master?filepath=MPCP.ipynb)

You may have to wait a minute for the notebook server to start.

**Warning:** you get a temporary clone of this repository on mybinder.org, but it will eventually disappear!
So be sure to copy or download any revised code that you want to keep.
